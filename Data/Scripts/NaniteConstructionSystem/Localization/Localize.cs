Friendly Nanite Control Facilities within {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.MasterSlaveDistance}m of each
other will automatically join together and combine upgrades and
target scanning to both increase performance and productivity.

All settings within individual facilities are respected and no
additional configuration is needed. It should mostly feel like
nothing has changed, but you may notice a few things:

<--- {Localize(33)} --->

Inventories are shared between Facilities as well as their grids
and subgrids. That means that if two separate grids with
individual conveyor systems and cargo containers and their own
Nanite Control Facilities are floating nearby each other, they
may join up and be able to pull construction/repair and
projection components for jobs from each other's inventories.
This may or may not be desired, but for now, it's not
configurable. Just be aware of it.

Conversely, items retrieved from deconstruction jobs, cleanup
jobs and mining will sometimes appear in friendly facilities'
inventories. This is normal.

In the future, it may be possible for the developers to add
better support for inventory operations.

When this box is checked in a Nanite Control Facility, it will scan
for nearby Nanite Ore Detectors within {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.OreDetectorToNaniteFactoryCommunicationDistance}m.
If an ore detector is found, the facility will attempt to download
any ore target information from the ore detector. This usually takes
a few seconds.

A Nanite Ore Detector is very different from the built-in ore
detectors that you are probably familiar with. Unlike the vanilla
ore detectors, a Nanite Ore Detector does NOT provide the player
with on-screen locations of ore. Instead, the Nanite Ore Detector
carefully scans nearby voxels (asteroids or planets) for their
material content, then saves the information in its onboard
data storage.

These blocks are fairly large (3x5x3) and also have eight upgrade
slots which can take up an additional two spaces on each side.
Plan accordingly.

There's no need to connect the ore detector to any conveyor system.
The only thing it needs is a fair amount of power. All data is
transferred wirelessly: It doesn't even have to be on the same
grid as any Nanite Control Facility.

Once your Nanite Ore Detector is built, consider installing some
upgrades. Nanite Ore Detector Scanning Upgrades allow the ore
detector to find more valuable materials, such as gold and
platinum. Only two are needed to maximize the scanning frequency.

Also consider installing a single Nanite Ore Detector Filter
Upgrade, which allows the user to select which ore location data
will be stored. This is good for filtering out more common materials
like stone or ice. Simple highlight the ores in the list that should
be stored (CTRL + click by default).

Install as many Nanite Ore Detector Range Upgrades as
desired. Each one will increase the detector's maximum range by {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.OreDetectorRangePerUpgrade}m.

Actual range scanned is controlled by a slider in the control panel.
Larger ranges will take longer to scan the area, so be sure to only
scan what is needed to save time. To visualize the scanning area,
a convenient checkbox in the ore detector will project a spherical
measurement of the scanning range.

Finally, consider installing Nanite Ore Detector Power Efficiency
Upgrades if power consumption is a concern. Each upgrade will reduce
the total power consumed by {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.OreDetectorPowerPercentReducedPerEfficiencyUpgrade * 100} percent.

ALL of the above mentioned upgrades are installed on the Nanite
Ore Detector itself, NOT on the Nanite Control Facility.

WARNING: Multiple Nanite Ore Detectors within {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.OreDetectorToNaniteFactoryCommunicationDistance}m
of each other will shut down automatically, as their radio waves
will block out each others' signals. Only one Ore Detector is
needed, even for many facilities within range. Once any problems
are rectified, restart the Ore Detector by switching it back on
in the control panel.

Once the Ore Detector has the desired upgrades installed and has
been configured properly in the control panel, turn it on. The
scanning radar in the middle of the detector will begin to quickly
spin. Monitor the progress of the scanning by viewing the info
terminal in the right side of the control panel.

If properly configured, nearby, online Nanite Control Facilities
will produce RED nanites, which will then travel to the desired
ores and extract them with surgical precision. No undesired
materials will be disturbed, even if the ore vein is completely
surrounded by stone, dirt or ice.

To make the nanites travel faster, install Nanite Speed Upgrades
on the facility. To produce more mining nanites at once,
install Nanite Mining Upgrades on the facility.

If a target is found, YELLOW nanites will be produced by the
facility and move toward the target. The item will then be
added to the Facility's inventory.

If the Nanite Facility's inventory is over 75% full, the facility
will flush its inventory into any free cargo containers on the grid.
This is to make room for the objects that the cleanup nanites are
trying to pick up.

In the future, this functionality will be more configurable and
obey sorters and other inventory rules.

To reduce the time it takes for nanites to clean up objects,
install Nanite Speed Upgrades on any of the facility's eight
upgrade slots.

To increase the amount of cleanup nanites the factory can

<--- Nanite Beacons --->

Nanite Control Facilities will automatically queue jobs for targets
on the same grid or attached as subgrids, but what about for other
friendly grids nearby? This is where Beacons come in handy.

There are three beacons: Repair, projection and deconstruction.

REPAIR: When built on a grid, Nanite Facilities within {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.ConstructionMaxBeaconDistance}m
will scan that grid for blocks that need repaired.

PROJECTION: These should be built on a grid that has a projector that
is projecting a blueprint to be built. All Nanite Control Facilities
within {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.ProjectionMaxBeaconDistance}m will build that projection.

DECONSTRUCTION: When this beacon is built on a grid, Facilities within
{NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.DeconstructionMaxDistance}m will grind down every block on that grid.

Please note that control panel checkboxes on the Nanite Control
Facility must still be properly configured for the beacons to be
detected.

<--- Area Beacons --->

An Area Beacon is a special beacon that defines an entire area,
rather than a specific grid, for operations. Build this block on
any grid within {NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.AreaBeaconMaxDistanceFromNaniteFacility}m from a Nanite Facility.
Then, configure the size and shape of the area in the control panel.
Finally, use the checkboxes to determine what operations should take
place within that area (if you're making a chop shop, ONLY check
Deconstruction or you may get undesired results).

<--- What are Nanites? --->

Nanites are tiny, flying machines that can easily do many things.
Here's what they are currently configured to do:

- Welding: {(NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.ConstructionEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled")}
- Grinding: {(NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.DeconstructionEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled")}
- Mining: {(NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.MiningEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled")}
- Cleanup loose objects: {(NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.CleanupEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled")}
- Build projections: {(NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.ProjectionEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled")}
- Heal players: {(NaniteConstructionManager.Settings.LifeSupportEnabled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled")}

Nanites are created and given orders in a Nanite Control Facility.
These 'factory' blocks can be built on any grid just like any
other block in Space Engineers.

Many players use nanites to greatly reduce the time spent doing
the more tedious tasks in the game, such as welding hundreds
of armor blocks by hand. More advanced players can use them to
extract ore from asteroids and planets without touching a drill,
set up automatic ship factories using projectors, or create
chop shops that deconstruct grids within range.

<--- Getting Started --->

First, you'll need to build a Nanite Control Facility.

It's usually pretty expensive, so make sure you have a good amount of
resources and a good grasp of production mechanics before you begin.
The large grid version is 3x3x3, with upgrade slots that stick out
an additional block on each side (5x5x3), so plan accordingly.

Build the facility so it has access to your grid's conveyor system.
The large grid facility has five conveyor connections. One is on
the bottom in the very middle. If viewed from the bottom, that side
looks like this:

                    XXX
                    XOX
                    XXX

where O is the conveyor connection.

The others are on each side on the bottom middle like so:

                    XXX
                    XXX
                    UOU

where O is the conveyor connection and U is where upgrades
can be installed. Upgrade slots CANNOT be used for conveyor
connections, and conversely, conveyor connections will not
support upgrades.

For more information about upgrades, type in chat:
/nanite help upgrades

When repairing blocks and building projections, the facility will
use your grid's connected inventory blocks, such as cargo
containers, to find the parts it needs to do its job.

Power availability can also limit the factory's performance.
Make sure you have ample power and fuel available, especially before
adding upgrades or building additional facilities.

<--- Configuration --->

Once your factory is up and running, open the terminal and scroll down
to see the various checkboxes. Here, you can control what the factory
will or wont do. 'Use Assemblers' is off by default. Check this box
to allow the factory to use assemblers on the same conveyor system
to create parts that are needed for jobs. For more information, type:
/nanite help assemblers

<--- Nanite Facility Colors --->

The Nanite Control Facilities color emitters (located on the 'arms' of
the block) will indicate the current status of the facility.

RED means the facility is disabled. You can turn the facility on and
off by accessing the grid control panel from any terminal, including
the 'monitor' on the Nanite Control Facility itself.

DARK PURPLE (with lightning effects) means the facility is active.
The center spinning orb will move up or down depending on the
status of active jobs. When all the way up, the facility will
make crackling sounds and the lightning will appear. This is the
state that actively creates the nanites themselves.

DEEP PINK (BLINKING) means the facility is missing parts for a job.
Either supply the missing components manually, or check out this
command for more information about automatic assembly:
/nanites help assemblers

DARK YELLOW (BLINKING) means the facility does not have enough
power to enter a nominal state. Increase the grid's power by
creating new reactors/batteries/solar panels or adding more fuel.

LIME (BLINKING) means the facility has invalid targets. This state
is a bit of a wildcard as many things can go wrong, such as
unfriendly facilities already working on targets. Fore more
information on this status, open the terminal of the facility
and scroll down in the information area on the right side.

DARK GREEN means the facility is enabled but currently has no
jobs to do. As long as the proper checkboxes are enabled in the
control panel, the facility will always be actively scanning for
jobs to do while in this state. Certain conditions must be met
for certain situations, however. See the help commands for
mining, beacons and area beacons for more information.

<--- Nanite Colors --->

The nanites themselves will have different colors depending on
what job they are doing and what status they have.

GREEN is a nanite returning from a completed task.

BRIGHT RED is a nanite moving to a mining target (ore or stone).
DARK RED is a nanite coming back from a mining target.

YELLOW is a nanite moving to clean up loose items and bring
them back to the facility's inventory.

PINK is a nanite moving to build a projection target.

CYAN is a nanite moving to deconstruct a block.

WHITE is a nanite moving to heal a player.

BLUE is a nanite moving to construct/repair a block.

For non-mining targets, DARK RED means a nanite is returning
from a task that has failed for some reason.
